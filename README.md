# Backup of configurations

To easy start on a fresh machine. Just run `./setup` and `./alfred` (for navigation help).

Idea from [here](https://github.com/neuhalje/homesick-bash), [here](https://medium.com/@satorusasozaki/manage-your-dotfiles-on-github-8f8a2a57c85.), and my collegues.

I want to discover more of this later on: https://freshshell.com/ for improved handling of dotfiles and importing other people's stuff. 

Might be very useful.
